title='Mathematical Model with Social Distancing Parameter for Early Estimation of COVID-19 Spread', 
content='COVID-19 is well known to everyone in the world. It has spread around the world. No vaccine or antiviral treatment is available till now. COVID-19 patients are increasing day by day. All countries have adopted social distancing as a preventive measure to reduce spread. It becomes necessary to estimate the number of peoples going to be affected with COVID-19 in advance so that necessary arrangements can be done. Mathematical models are used to provide early disease estimation based on limited parameters. In the present manuscript, a novel mathematical model with a social distancing parameter has been proposed to provide early COVID-19 spread estimation. The model has been validated with real data set. It has been observed that the proposed model is more accurate in spread estimation.',

title='Importance of Interaction Structure and Stochasticity for Epidemic Spreading: A COVID-19 Case Study', 
content='In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, computer simulations are used to predict the evolution of the virus propagation and to evaluate the prospective effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions. As such, the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision-making. Typically, ODE-based models are considered, in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time. In this work, we translate an ODE-based COVID-19 spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi-agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures. We observe a large dependency of the epidemic&#x27;s dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph, which is not adequately captured by existing ODE-models. For instance, existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders. Overall, we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics, which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0. We conclude that deterministic models fitted to COVID-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights.',

title='Importance of suppression and mitigation measures in managing COVID-19
  outbreaks', 
content='  I employ a simple mathematical model of an epidemic process to evaluate how four basic quantities: the reproduction number (R), the numbers of sensitive (S) and infectious individuals(I), and total community size (N) affect strategies to control COVID-19. Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. We discuss the predictions of this analysis and how it fits into longer-term sequences of measures, including using the herd immunity concept to leverage acquired immunity. ',
